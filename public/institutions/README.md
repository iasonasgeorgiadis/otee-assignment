# Institution Logos

Place optimized institution-specific logo assets in this directory so they can
be served statically by Vite and Storybook. Use short, kebab-cased filenames
(for example, `university-of-example.png`) and prefer transparent PNG or SVG
formats sized appropriately for the header component.

Current sample assets:

- `atypon-wiley-brand.jpg`
- `columbia-university-logo.png`

> Tip: if you later decide to add an optimization pipeline similar to the
brand logos, keep this directory as the output location and store the source
artwork elsewhere (e.g. `brand/institutions/master/`).
